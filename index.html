        <h2>Welcome to Red Light Gaming! ðŸŽ‰</h2>
        <p>Our story began on January 27th, 2023, when we launched a completely rebranded community server. Before that, we had another server, but decided to start fresh with the name "Red Light Gaming" â€“ it just popped into our heads and stuck!</p>
        <p>We're all about chill people looking for a chill community where everyone is welcome. Weâ€™ve built a space where you can relax and connect with others who share your passion for gaming.</p>
        <h2>Our Focus</h2>
        <p>Unlike many other gaming servers, we focus on specific games: <u>Guild Wars 2</u>, <u>Warframe</u>, <u>Rocket League</u>, <u>Project Zomboid</u>, and <u>Apex Legends</u>. But this doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™re not welcome! While these are our core titles, everyone is warmly welcomed into our community, regardless of what you play.</p>
        <h2>Our Community</h2>
        <p>We're primarily an NA East-based community (operating in EST time zone), but players of all regions are welcome. Please keep in mind that our events and schedules are based on Eastern Standard Time, which might not be ideal for everyone. However, weâ€™re incredibly excited to have players from all over the world as part of our Red Light Gaming family!</p>
